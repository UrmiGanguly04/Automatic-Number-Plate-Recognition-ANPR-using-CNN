# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-ANPR-using-CNN
The aim of this project is to develop an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. The system detects vehicle number plates from an image, segments individual characters, and recognize them using a trained CNN model.
